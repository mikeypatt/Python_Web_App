CACHING

To cache you need to first download redis. On Mac you can do this with 
homebrew and the command "brew install redis". 

Once downloaded setup a redis server by typing "redis-server" into the command
line and hitting enter. In a different command line window you an then check it
is working by typing "redis-cli ping" if PONG is returned then the server is
running. 

While the server is running you can launch the app. 

UPDATE: Don't need to do this anymore
